# Shell Game

Making a browser game w/ javascript for [Shell Game quests in WoW.](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=51627/shell-game) Right now I have jQuery loaded for the randomizing until I get closer to the end. Seems like this will be interesting & fun to play with.

So what I want to do here is create a card/memory game (Check the above link) using JavaScript. I think this will be a great learning experience for me.

I'll try to update the readme when I make changes so you don't have to go through the entire commit history.
